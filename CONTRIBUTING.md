# Contributing

## Workflow
- Fork + branch (feature/*, fix/*, refactor/*)
- PR small and reviewable
- Add tests for behavior changes
- Update docs/context/* if you change assumptions or models

## Code style
- Keep hot-path clean
- Avoid heavy dependencies
- Prefer explicitness over “cleverness”

## Commit messages
Use conventional-ish style:
- feat: ...
- fix: ...
- refactor: ...
- docs: ...
- test: ...
